  "description": "One of the most recent and significant discussions in AS is how to reconfigure the field in ways that will systematically advance innovative research and transformative knowledge production. In the new turn of AS driven by transdisciplinary, transnational, and collaborative flavour, it is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the roles of ethical review committees in the execution of non-exploitative research in AS. Though Research Ethics (RE) has a long history in Western culture as a corrective mechanism to the violently Nazi unethical experimental saga on the ways medical doctors conducted research on their patients, today, RE covers research not only in the medical sciences but also in the humanities in so far as human agents are involved. Empirically oriented research in AS today requires going through the ethical review process guided by the Western infrastructure of ethics. While the classical model of doing AS on Africans/African soil and funded in the global ‘North’ has often created the phenomenon of ‘ethics dumping’, far too little attention has been paid to how ethics dumping can be avoided in the evolving model of reconfiguring AS through equal partnerships and research collaborations. Though ethics dumping is not an end in itself as it is a process mediated by contextual factors and characterised by power relationships, it is important to investigate its nuances, its depth, and the structures that can mitigate its prevalence in the contemporary AS research space.\nSome studies have documented the research ethics governance structures in some African states (Sambiéni (2018), Chilisa (2019), Chatfield et al. (2020), Schoeman (2019), Cook, Chatfield, and Schroeder (2019), Yakubu (2017), Chu, et al. (2014), Chantler et al (2013), Goduka (1990)). Insofar as these studies are instructive, there has been no discussion on the multiple-space African-inspired theoretical exploration of research ethics protocol. While African states, including Burkina Faso, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, are no exceptions to the universal ideals of having research ethics committees, the histories, circumstances of emergence, configuration and structures, powers, and limitations of such committees in the three countries are diverse with some common interesting grounds, worthy of investigation. Given the history of unethical and exploitative research in Africa, it is urgent and important to take seriously the question of research moralities in AS without ethical imperialism (Fayemi & Macaulay-Adeyelure, 2016). Pertinent research questions to this study include: How can AS be done without ethics dumping? How can AS be reconfigured through research ethics that is decolonized? What are the efforts in having indigenous research ethics governance in some African states and how can such documents be harmonized to reflect African cultural realities?\nCurrently, there is no study profiling the variations, the extent, the contents and overlaps of the mechanism for research ethics capacity-building among the West African, East African, and Southern African regions. Also, there are no studies interrogating in close context, whether the establishment of research ethics in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa is an (un)intended imperialistic project. Therefore, it is important to stress the understanding of the ambience, contents, and mechanisms of capacity-building in research ethics in each of these countries as critical to shaping future directions in AS. In reconfiguring AS, it is important to investigate whether Western research ethics interact or contradict national and regional ethical frameworks in Africa. This study aims to determine and examine the existing research ethics governance structure and the principles underpinning its operations in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. It seeks to unpack the extent of ethics dumping pre-eminence in research ethics committees' operations while also evaluating the nature and impacts of research ethics capacity-building programmes on the epistemic integrity of research and knowledge production in AS. By so doing, the study seeks to develop an African-multisite-inspired research ethics protocol for prescriptive use inequitable collaborative and transnational research in AS. Considering the growing wave of decolonizing the disciplines and methodologies in AS, the proposed project aims at reconfiguring AS through a decolonised lens of research ethics. In decolonizing research ethics from a ‘one-size-fits all’ model, this project draws on the ACC core concepts of multiplicity, reflexivity, positionality, and relationality. The project will explore multiple local contexts of research ethics review in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa to harmonize overlapping ideals and research ethics standards. The study plans to collaborate with all the ACCs to evolve research ethics protocols for AS grounded on indigenous epistemologies and values.",

  "description": "The aim of this study is to investigate the neglect of municipal roads and the development implications in Africa. In this study, we will address the issue of abandonment of the majority of municipal roads and the construction of a few, and how this affects human lives and socio-economic development in Africa.\n\nResearch Objectives\n\nSpecific objectives are to: \n\ni. Investigate the socio-political and economic explanations for the neglect of municipal road construction in Nigeria and Kenya; ii.Examine the rationales for the construction of a few municipal roads and the inattention of majority in both countries; iii. Explore the development implications of abandoned municipal roads in study areas; iv.Recommend new strategies for improved and sustained municipal road construction in the study areas. Research Questions i.What are the socio-economic and political reasons for neglecting municipal road construction in Nigeria and Kenya? \n\nii. What are the justifications for the construction of few municipal roads and the neglect of majority?\n\niii. How and why do neglected municipal roads affect development?\n\niv. Why and how should/can the Nigerian and Kenyan governments improve and sustain municipal road construction?\n\nThe Basic Needs Theory (BNT) will be adopted in this project. This theory is being used increasingly to address the issue of community development. It comprises not just the needs of a family but also essential services provided by and for the community such as pipe borne water, sanitation, public transport, health, and education. In the 1970s, several events such as The Cocoyoc Declaration (1974), What Now – Another Development? (1975), and Catastrophe or New Society? A Latin American Model (1976), to mention a few, influenced the formulation of the BNT. This approach focuses on the dilemma of the poor and neglected communities, especially at the grassroots level. Its overarching idea is to provide people with basic needs, including income-earning opportunities. This theory is relevant to this present project because it emphasises the provision of commodities and public services to those in need especially at the local government level.\n\nIn this subject area, there are relevant literature which provide necessary background knowledge and guide to this present work. Timo Henckel and Warwick McKibbin’s (2010), “The Economics of Infrastructure in a Globalized World: Issues, Lessons and Future Challenges,” Remi Jedwab and Adam Storeygard’s (2017) Economic and Political Factors in Infrastructure Investment: Evidence from Railroads and Roads in Africa, 1960-2015, Joseph Wales and Leni Wild’s (2012), “The Political Economy of Roads: An Overview and Analysis of Existing Literature,” Kenya Gazette Supplement, (2017), and Muhammed Abdullahi and Aliyu Chikaji’s (2017), “Local Government and Development: Challenges and Way Forward.” Henckel et al, examine the nature of infrastructure, how it’s being evaluated and delivered and its impact on the economy. They raised issues such as how should infrastructure be provided? who should provide it? government or private sector? This work did not address the problems associated with municipal road construction. Jedwab et al, focus on railroads and national roads construction in Africa. The authors highlight the determinants and/or drivers of infrastructure investment. Their work provides the history of national road construction in 43 Sub-Saharan African states. They elucidate on the socio-economic and political trajectory of paved national roads and highways. Like Henckel et al, critical examination of issues of neglect of municipal roads, were evidently missing in their discussion. Wales et al, concentrate on the political economy of rural road networks. The study unravels a variety of governance conditions and factors which affect outcomes. Kenya Gazette Supplement, discusses the classification of national trunk and county roads, the establishment of road authorities and public roads standard board and financial provisions for road constructions. In this gazette, municipal roads and their inherent issues were not captured. Abdullahi et al, look at the role of the local government at the grassroots level, factors that impede development and effective administration, their relationship with both the national and state governments and how this influences the operations of the local government. One critical aspect of desertion in the above-reviewed literature and several others is the neglect of municipal/county roads and its impact on mobility of people, goods, services and development.\n\nResearch/Data Sites\n\nThis study, for relational multiplicity, focuses on Nigeria and Kenya. Both countries were colonized by the British and have a similar history and/or policy of road construction and infrastructure development. Both countries are commanding economics in their regions,and known for poor municipal/county roads. Research assistants will complement the work of the research team.",

  "description": "Various scholars have studied African migrations but have largely neglected to consider the complexities especially in the decade of state failure and economic depression. The flow of people and resources at the sub-regional scale has also received limited scholarly interrogation. What is apparent is that West Africa is characterised by internal mobility and has the highest rate of migration in Africa, with an estimated intra-regional migration of 70-83%. In the decade after the economic depression, many young persons including professionals began a migratory movement in search of economic opportunities. People from Ghana, Benin and Togo come to Nigeria to work as domestics, artisans and teachers. Young Nigerians move to Ghana and Cote D'Ivoire to work in the ICT hubs, while others work as vendors in the second-hand clothing markets. Nigerians also migrate to Benin and Togo to trade and work in the automobile sector. Some others move to Senegal, Burkina Faso and Niger as a prelude to future migration to other African regions and beyond. As these flows are largely informal, undocumented and sometimes illegal (even criminal), while some ECOWAS member states welcome migrants as contributors to economic development and regional cohesion, others consider them to be drivers of insecurity and economic miscreants. Nonetheless, in the course of such migrations, both the material and non-material culture are deemed to move, hence new social identities and (sub)cultures are formed.\n\nIn many instances, migrant enclaves emerge - integrating with the larger city for economic reasons, while attempting to preserve social identities. Therefore this study will seek to establish how migrant enclaves interface with their host cities in the contexts of livelihoods, acculturation and even political praxis. Lagos, Cotonou, Accra and Ouagadougou are purposely selected as case study sites because they expressly represent the anglophone-francophone diversity and are primate cities of their respective countries. Furthermore, there is anecdotal evidence of significant migrant activities within these cities which we will attempt to empirically ascertain.\n\nAfrican culture and language are considered interesting work spaces within African studies, more so because it is almost impossible to detach language and culture from a people. Culture influences the structure and functions of a group, while language influences their individual interpretation of reality (Ayeomoni, 2011). While we recognise the ethnic similitude of many West African peoples, this study will seek to explore how language, religion and culture(ie fashion, cuisine and art) are being reconstructed in the various migrant enclaves, as well as the peculiar forms of social identities being formed. The West African sub-region is made up of countries whose current socio-political practices still bear vestiges of their colonial legacies. This study will interrogate how these differentials play out in the operationalisation of regional integration agreements i.e. ECOWAS protocols and streetscale political practice.\n\nThis study becomes necessary seeing that despite the intense movements of people and resources within the West African sub-region, the patterns and implications of such movements are under-reported and more likely to be based on anecdotal rather than empirical evidence. Where academic studies on migration in West Africa exist, they often adopt a singular disciplinary focus, narrowly examining the operationalisation of formalised (ECOWAS enabled) protocols. Therefore, we seek to bridge this knowledge gap by ascertaining who and what moves informally within and across the West African sub-region, and how such mobilities shape everyday urban processes and socio-cultural dynamics.\n\nThe aim of this research is to interrogate - through multidisciplinary lens - spatial mobilities of people and resources across West African cities, and the interface across socio - economic, cultural and political milieu. Specific objectives include: \n\ni. Map traditional and emerging socio-economic flows and routes across West Africa.\nii. Determine the flow of youth and labour migrations in the West African sub-region.\niii. Establish the constraints and enablers of peculiar types of mobility and migration\niv. Ascertain the contexts of ethnic enclaving, acculturation and (re)identities through migration.\nv. Appraise existing ECOWAS protocols vis a vis study finding (i – iii above)\n\nWe note that there are two ongoing projects within the African Cluster Centre (Lagos ACC and Moi ACC) that address aspects of migration in Africa. Our proposal is a clear departure from these two because of the geographic context in that it encompases a study of urban socio-spatial mobilities in West Africa. ",

  "description": "This project examines how communities, or peoples on the geographical margins of African states have (historically) exercised agency by creating alternative centres of power and by engaging in some unusual, unpredictable, and at times ‘deviant’ practices (from a statist point of view) in order to circumvent the state that often fail to service their needs. Known in other contexts as borderland communities, such societies are usually the greatest victims, not only of the weak, fragile, or collapsed state, but also of (politically) belligerent states that however lack the economic capacity and/or political will to support those who live further away from the centre. Thus, the marginalised engage in various forms of mobilisations from their vantage points to defy state institutions and structures. They establish sophisticated cross border goods smuggling networks; have illegal border jumping and human trafficking syndicates; engage in organised poaching; illegal mining; self-provisioning of land; illicit weapon acquisition and trade; tax evasions; sustain a network of religious, ritualistic and ethnic solidarities that know no state boundaries. Some resort to alternative forms of banking and use of foreign currencies from across the border in response to economic collapse, etc. These and other forms of expression demonstrates the agency of the underdogs in chatting a different kind of politics either by engaging the state, when it suits them or by existing/disengaging/deserting state institutions either individually or as ‘collective dissidents’.1 Examining these multiple responses from marginalised societies decentres the generally ‘bourgeois’ bias in African (and Area) studies scholarship which tends to privilege the state as a unit for scholarly analysis. Although we recognise the hegemonic position of the state, we want to ask questions about Africa’s ‘low politics’. By ‘low politics’, we mean those hidden, yet recurrent practices and behaviour at a local level that are neither birthed by nor controlled by ‘high politics’ (as in structured or hierarchically institutionalised hegemonic politics of the state).2 Communities tend to reproduce certain practices, turning them into the heartbeat of their ‘everyday’, yet such practices are malleable as they are constantly reworked and perfected due to changing realities facing those communities. When communities keep reinventing themselves, it becomes difficult for the state to insert itself and regulate certain practices, especially in areas where state control is weak, and the grassroots resolve too strong. \n\nThus, we ask key questions such as: How do people in some African communities selfidentify? What alternative economies exists outside the ambit of the state and what does that existence signify? How do neighbouring communities or relatives that are divided by the national boundaries interact when their political regimes seek to control and regulate their human, financial, ideational, cultural, and other attendant mobilities and affiliations across borders? Lastly, how could all this work impact on African Studies generally, and historical studies particularly.",

  "description": "Folktales are fictional oral literature with cultural contents and characterization, created to aid the learning and developmental processes of the child (Akporobaro 2001, Ajikobi 2007, Gomez 2016). As a form of informal learning, the folktale is crafted by sages, who are mostly women, as a communal verbal art which addresses such themes as humanity, discipline, religion, leadership, integrity and their importance, in a bid to maintain generations with strong morals and sustainable ways of life. However, folktales have not enjoyed sufficient interest in African societies in recent times (Alade, Folaranmi, & Odejobi 2015). This research, which aims to produce African contents, specifically Yorùbá, for children’s entertainment and moral learning, is an attempt to create an indigenous alternative to oriental and occidental animations using Yorùbá folktales.\n\nIn addition, this research will contribute to restructuring African studies by moving the folktales away from the usual oral and anthologised forms that they have appeared on pages of books, to a more appealing, dramaturgical and modernised form. This research will contribute to the Knowledge Laboratory by making the folktales readily available for future reference.",

  "description": "In this project, we engage with a variety of entertainment forms such as stand-up comedy, hip hop music, spoken-word poetry and musicalized histories and biographies as popular entertainment 'forms' that are reshaping the cultural economies of African urban centres. Though the appeal of these forms cut across social and literacy strata, often drawing a huge congregation of consumers at performance sites, they are often categorised as ‘popular arts’, a term of informality that obscures their capacities and promotes a reluctance of the academy to engage with them as repositories of social knowledge. Forms perceived and categorised as ‘informal’ can have significant decolonising imports for a new understanding of the African entertainment economy. They can also enrich the methodological and theoretical reviews entailed in the ACC project of reconfiguring African Studies. We therefore propose to collate, characterise and archive these resources to enable access to them as a first step in the effort to rein them in for widespread scholarly engagements and subsequent inclusion in African studies curricula.",

  "description": "This research critically analyses the artistic trajectory of two women artists in Africa as a starting point into broader and more complex conversations about the conservancy and alternative archivisation of artistic practices on the continent. The two artists include Agness Buya Yombwe from Zambia and Elizabeth Olowu who is of Nigerian descent. While there is considerable information about female artists in the West, there is a gaping lack of knowledge about African women artists of specific generations that are based on the continent. This research identifies this gap also in the study of women artists in Africa within the field of the contemporary arts of Africa, as such it foregrounds the importance of roles by women in African societies and highlights the need for their inclusion in the writing of a holistic global history. On one layer this research provides an in-depth engagement with each of the two artists’ practices, while on another level it offers a comparative analysis of the artistic discourses of women artists between the Nigerian and Zambian contexts. Last but not least, this research offers insights into how women artists navigate hierarchical and masculine socio-political and religious contexts that are prevalent in their geographic locations.",

  "description": "Ever since the late African philosopher, Odera Oruka, put forward his conception of Philosophic Sagacity as an authentic African philosophy, widespread discussion on this position has made Philosophic Sagacity so authoritative that it is proposed as one of the most reliable sources of African knowledges (Mosima, 2016). Perhaps owing to the influence of Paul Radin (1927) and his gender-restrictive reference to “man” in the discovery of African knowledges, Oruka and his followers seemed also to have excluded women from the category of sages. Thus, despite the possible existence of many female powerhouses of wisdom in Africa, and despite the global push for equal opportunities and recognition for women, the Sage Philosophy project is still predominantly chauvinistic. This research project titled “Women as Sages: Exploring the nature and value of Feminine Wisdom” is an agenda-setting work that seeks to investigate the possibility of woman sages, the nature and content of the form of knowledge they produce, and the value of such knowledges to the contemporary African and others.",

  "description": "The project investigates the mobility of West African migrants using Lagos and Ouagadougou as research contexts. In this project, we set out to ascertain the integration of migrants in their destination context by juxtaposing their occupational engagements in terms of accessibility to the formal or informal sector. The migrants’ accessibility to education, health care and if they suffered any form of conflict or molestation to capture the existence or otherwise of xenophobia in the two countries. To achieve the set objectives 1000 questionnaires were administered in Lagos and Ouagadougou (500 in each context). The results of the study showed that migrants in Ouagadougou and Lagos operate in the informal sector of the economy either as petty traders, food vendors, transporters etc. Migrants in Ouagadougou had equal access to public education as citizens whereas the reverse was the situation in Lagos. For health care, 99.8% of migrants in Ouagadougou had access to health care. Interestingly, migrants in Lagos experienced some form of fear as 24.60% expressed the desire to return to origin context as against only 3.10% in Ouagadougou. The study shows that migrants in Ouagadougou are completely integrated and therefore do not desire to return. The fear expressed by some migrants in Lagos negates the spirit and letters of the ECOWAS Protocol and thus, negates the AU migration policy framework 2018–2030.\" of such knowledges to the contemporary African and others.",

  "description": "This project will analyse and evaluate the long-lost TV film, Taiwo Shango: Der 2. Tag nach dem Tod (TS) (1965) — a coproduction by the Bavarian Broadcasting Cooperation (BR), West German Broadcasting (WDR), and Nigerian Television Service (NTS) — in relation to contemporaneous cultural production in Nigeria. Directed by Klaus Stephan, BR’s ‘resident specialist correspondent’, the film makes controversial use of a historical incident – the interruption of the ritual suicide at Oyo (1946) – that Wole Soyinka responded to in Death and the King’s Horseman (1975), and which inspired Duro Ladipo’s ‘Yoruba opera’ Oba Waja (1964). Shot almost entirely with Nigerian actors on location, the film sits uneasily at the juncture of an emerging national Nigerian television service, post-independence cultural production (specifically in connection to Yoruba Travelling Theatre, the Mbari Clubs and Ulli Beier), Stephan’s journalistic out-put and the work of his wife, Nina Fischer-Stephan, photographer and filmmaker. We propose to analyse the context in which TS was produced, the modalities of production, the distribution of and responses to the film. We will study its multi-layered, multi-lingual aesthetics in relation to contemporaneous Nigerian works, including its soundtrack for which Akin Euba was the musical consultant. Above all, we will pay attention to the intersection of gender, race, nationality, religion and class to examine power relations both on - and off-screen. Our project is a first step towards the recuperation, appraisal and digitisation of two major private collections: the Fischer-/Stephan archive (Iwalewahaus), and the Lagos holdings of the late Segun Olusola, producer and actor in TS, and a neglected pioneer of Nigerian television. The project contributes to the RS Arts & Aesthetics’ objective to study the multidirectional flows of creative works, and how they contribute to social and artistic experiences across, and beyond, West Africa and Europe.",

  "description": "This project engages in a relational study of the Ifa Indigenous knowledge system as practised amongst the Yoruba-African people home and diaspora in Nigeria, Benin and Brazil; targeting thoughts about the state, governance system, constitution, justice, equality, equity, citizenship, nationalism, environment, gender, sexuality, global justice and other central socio-political discourses that derive therefrom. This is considered a potential foundation for new theoretical and methodological heritages that are based on African epistemological and metaphysical axioms which, in practical terms, can augment efforts towards addressing the ever-complex socio-political challenges across the globe. Ifa is the intellectual heritage of Orunmila that is organised into 256 oral-symbolic signatures (odu). Odu rendition is usually poetic with accompanying stories, songs, proverbs and liturgies; each representing a basket of knowledge derived from lived experiences Modefi and Ama 2009. Babalawo and iyanifa are the schooled Ifa cognoscenti cum intelligentsia. Their training and experience can enable them identify and analyse the 256 odu into interpretative (not intuitive) divination. This aspect is based on faith and spirituality, and can also – as has been – projected as religion. The socio-political thoughts that derive from the 256 odu Ifa are the focus of this project. As the intellectual heritage of Orunmila, Ifa has endured as part of state cum community executive, legislative and judicial institutions right from the outset of Yoruba civilization. The Oluwo (head of Ifa literati) is involved in all state and community political processes including king-making, wars, epidemics, pandemics, conflicts, diplomacy and constitution. Oluwo relies solely on Orunmila’s thoughts and theories in the 256 odu to analyse issues and guide decision making during all of the processes. As evident in its spread around the world, Ifa is learnt without any special gift and, or intuitive power. It is open to male and female, young and old irrespective of tribes, races and tongues.",

  "description": "The project examines how memories of slavery are constructed in UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Gorée (Senegal), Ouidah (Benin), Cartagena (Colombia) and Salvador da Bahia (Brazil). It is based on the premise that these heritage sites respond to touristic telos and readings of history that do not go uncontested by alternative memory sites, media and discourses. In this regard, we establish a corpus of literary texts, film, audio/visual and performative arts that in/directly respond to the official sites and instigate alternative archives of lived and shared memories and trauma of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. In the case of Francophone African literature, this has been a relatively neglected subject in contrast to the long tradition in Anglophone and Lusophone countries. Apart from textual and cinematographic analyses, our research critically engages with performative audio/visual practices (photography, painting, comics, songs, etc.) which enter into dialogue with official documents produced in and for the museums/heritage sites.",

  "description": "Beyond the Digital Return researches repatriation/restitution and re/appropriation of submerged but now digitally accessible musical and cultural material. The significance of the relatedness of “digital return” to processes of heritage and identity production as well as the decolonisation of institutional music archives/repositories are investigated in three African countries: South Africa, Kenya, an Ghana, with affiliated research in Nigeria. The project contributes to Advocacy/Engaged/Applied Ethnomusicology, Archival Studies, Anthropology, African Heritage Studies, and Popular Music Studies. The project’s concerns are about assessing the value of digital return to the development of sustainable cultures and in what digital return reveals about global demands for decolonising archives and museums. Key questions are: what happens after the “digitised musical object” has been returned to its community of origin? Is digital return the answer to developing sustainable music cultures or reviving an interest in them where it may be the case that they are on the brink of collapse or extinction? The main objective of the project is to enhance our understanding of how repatriation in the field of music yields new forms of cultural creation associated with heritage, and, more precisely, intangible cultural heritage. This objective is informed by identity re/construction/affirmation as a result of accessibility, current trends of decolonising archives and the opening up of music archives, collections, and digital repositories (where much digitization has been achieved). These processes have for decades been frustrated by notions of colonial and corporate authority and ownership. The project thus also aims to contribute to currently increasing debates on restitution and related rights issues such as ownership, copyright, and intellectual property rights. ",

  "description": "The project is based on the insight that cultural and aesthetic articulations in the arts of today as far as they strive for global visibility are necessarily embedded in intercultural and mediatized exchanges, in processes of formal appropriation and recombination, of allusion and parody. In order to highlight their manifold and even contradictory character, they can be called dividuated articulations, according to a term used by Gilles Deleuze, incessantly recombining and transforming their aesthetic elements while nevertheless providing a singular expression. This characterization of time-based art productions seems to be even more true in times of globalized art languages, mediatized intercultural and aesthetic exchanges, mutual perceptions and appropriations. “African” aesthetic production may be considered even more dividuated due to the often-criticized extraversion, i.e. orientation of “Africa” towards the “West”, but also because of its involuntary (post)colonial dependencies on “Western” aesthetic norms and concepts, genres and formats, conditions of production and distribution. This observation goes along with the opposite one, namely that “African”artworks do become more and more self-assured in our times deciding themselves on their specific dividuations, criticizing or parodying their dependencies.",

  "description": "The project focuses on the multi-layered co-presence and circulation of verbal arts in relation to narratives, imagery, and sound travelling the Indian Ocean. In line with the Cluster’s agenda of multiplicity, we do not conceive of literary works as neatly delineated units, but as internally multiple and dynamic configurations in relation to other literary works and artworks. Taking into account networks of literary multilingualism and going beyond the monolingual straitjacket of modern literary histories and disciplinary boundaries that partition Lusoand Francophone literature from Swahili and Arabic, we adopt a multi-sited and multilingual approach. Bringing in our joint competences, we firstly, focus on the multilingual (foremost English, French, Portuguese, Swahili and Arabic) and multimedial practices of authors, the dynamic configuration of imagery, narratives and sounds in specific works and their relationship to other media and art forms (foremost film, music, installation). Our joint project focuses on the Indian Ocean, which lends itself to theorize artworks as multiple configurations that inhabit many worlds, which do not belong to one timeline, space, language and medium. Our project brings together three fields of inquiry, i.e. 1) recent multilingual approaches to circulating literatures; 2) Indian Ocean Studies and its emphasis on fluid connections, and 3) aesthetic approaches to consider the specific ways of the arts to evoke worlds.",

  "description": "The project is inspired by a perspective of multiplicity that foregrounds art collections and artworks as multi-layered configurations. It aims to look at art collections (on the African continent and, due to the pandemic, here in Germany), by starting analytically with artworks, their formal qualities and what these might bring to light, and exploring the object biographies of each artwork in a collaborative (!) and sensory approach, as all information is linked to the form and histories of the collections and the institutions associated with them. It also helps to question established narratives and one’s owns view on artworks and art worlds in general. The project builds on the work of previous research projects such as African Art History and the Formation of a Modern Aesthetic: African Modernism in Institutional Art Collections Related to German Collecting Activities, in which the history of modern art is seen as an intertwined history that needs to be considered from a trans-cultural perspective and in which collections are examined as networks, but also through an in-depth analysis of the biographies of singular artworks.",

  "description": "This project explores contemporary knowledge practices related to colonial “body archives” in Europe, using a media studies approach. Focusing on the mediality of anthropometric and forensic techniques of identification from 19th century colonial anthropology to the present, the project will investigate the making, travelling and (attempts of) undoing of knowledges around human categories of difference. \nThe project's outcome is four-fold: 1) It will provide a problematization of anthropological and forensic knowledge practices with respect to their colonial hauntings. 2) The project will contribute to theoretical and methodological questions how to understand multiplicity and relationality with respect to colonial knowledge. 3) Furthermore the project will enable a fundamental reflection of ubiquitous metric-statistical knowledge practices more generally. 4) Last but not least the project will investigate possibilities to design novel research foci on colonial hauntings in order to take the situatedness and multiplicity of knowledge practices into account in order to fully grasp how these colonial legacies have come to operate in colonial collections. And at the same time, it will actively search for and experiment with innovative methodologies that enable unexpected approaches of problematization, decolonization, and reconciliation with respect to colonial body archives. The outcomes of the one-year project will be the submission of two papers to an international peer-reviewed journal (e.g. Science, Technology, and Human Values; Science as Culture), and a presentation or a joint panel for the 4S&EASST conference in Prague (Society for Social Studies of Science & European Association for the Study of Science and Technology), August 2020. On this basis the proposed study will lead to a larger, more comprehensive research proposal on how to de-colonialize archives of the body.",

German industrialization, colonization, media of  mass culture and African plantation economy, enslavement  and infrastructures of transport are deeply intertwined.

Working at the intersections of Science and Technology Studies  (STS), Media Studies and Archaeology we follow the materials,  colonial practices and knowledges related to them, their  conditions of production, their routes of transportation as  well as administration, their material and medial transformations,  their discursive and visual attributions. \n\nThe project puts in dialogue research into colonial history  in Germany and Cameroon and enables a discussion on the  relationality of media history and colonial history for a range  of disciplines within African Studies (literature studies, film  studies, cultural history, Science and Technology Studies) and  beyond.",

  "description": "Letters were one of the major means of communication during the 19th-20th Century British colonialism of Africa. Through them, the instructions, intensions, decisions, complaints, justifications and agenda of resident British colonial officers, local colonial administrators and collaborators, colonial officials in Britain and colonised subjects were transmitted across time and space. These letters offer extraordinary access to the mindset and overall agenda of the entities producing them. The ways of life of these entities, their patterns of social order, repertoires and constellations of knowledges, linguistic voices, world views and cosmologies are projected, both directly and indirectly, in these letters. In themselves, these letters embody the contact zone of colonial-precolonial structures, coloniser-colonised entities, indigenous-foreign knowledges, cultural and linguistic practices, etc. This research project studies, from a predominantly linguistic perspective, the instantiations of colonial contact and postcolonial heritages that are embodied in, and transmitted through, letters written during British colonisation of Southern Cameroons (1916-1961). Markers of the construction of multiple identities, the discursive enactment of (social, political, hereditary) power and the coalescence of colonial and precolonial social norms of interaction (hierarchy, respect forms, kinship affiliation) found in these correspondences are studied from sociolinguistic, critical discourse analysis, discourse-historical, postcolonial linguistics, literary and historical perspectives.",

  "description": "Karakul sheep were first brought to Namibia in 1907 as part of a German colonial project. As Swakara, their pelts are sold to high end fashion designers. Until global fur markets collapsed in the 1980s and 1990s, Karakul farming was one of the most important industries in Namibia. Today, Swakara is embedded within narratives of sustainability, indigeneity, animal cruelty and development.\nIn our project, we are interested in the circulations of people, sheep and knowledges in and through postcolonial spaces and timescales. These Karakul circulations mark and transgress boundaries of race and species in multiple ways. Bred on an experimental farm in Halle (Germany) in the early 1900s, the sheep were exported to the colony of South-West Africa, where they played a major role in colonial settlement and economies. They were also crucial agents in scientific controversies on agriculture, Mendelian genetics and race. In our project, we approach these circulations through different sets of relations. In spatial terms, Karakul sheep connect Germany, colonial South-West Africa, Namibia and South Africa with other regions in the world. They are embedded in specific articulations of power and violence. Temporal circulations bring together German colonialism, South African imperial rule, colonial revisionism in Nazi Germany as well as heritage debates in independent Namibia. Karakul circulations also refer to traveling knowledges, their performed boundary work as well as the silences and absences they represent.",

  "description": "Shakespeare Source Studies has a strong tendency to focus on texts written in languages that Shakespeare is believed to have known how to read – Latin and English, of course, as well as Greek, Italian, French, and perhaps Spanish. So far, neither his knowledge of other languages nor non-English/European orality has received adequate attention. Apart from sporadic glances at English folktales (Artese 2015) and morality plays as well as Persian and Arabic (con)texts (Khairallah 2006, Al-Dab-bagh 2010, Avci 2016), Shakespeare Source Studies predominantly works within the fetters of a script-bound Eurocentric frame. Challenging this pattern, we wish to pursue the question whether and how African and East Asian (oral) literatures might have influenced Shakespearean drama. We wish to explore, theoretically, methodologically and empirically, how such relations can be substantiated and understood.",

  "description": "Heightened turmoil in the realm of global knowledge production has recently stimulated questions leading to research on inequalities and relationalities within the university; between universities in the “Global South” and “Global North”; as well as between experts and non-experts in a given society. The Junior Research Group “African Knowledges and the History Publication since the 1970s” suggests that the discipline of (African) History, with its sustained contestations over who qualifies as the ideal narrator of the past; what qualifies as a “proper” primary source; the conceptualisation time; and the politics of the archive, to name some examples, presents a particularly rich foundation for exploring this landscape.\n\nHow power enters the production of history is a critical but underexplored topic in the field. In his book Silencing the Past Michel-Rolph Trouillot locates fours crucial points when this occurs: 1) “the making of sources”; 2) “the making of archives”; 3) “the making of narratives”; and, 4) “the making of history in the final instance”. Furthermore, the book deals “with the many ways in which the production of historical narratives involves the uneven contribution of competing groups and individuals who have unequal access to the means for such productions” (xxiii). Using a media-centred approach, we want to explore interrelations between producers of history in public, popular and academic spheres on the continent. How do their works interact (or not)? What particular lessons can be drawn about the medialities of specific forms of expression, whether material or immaterial? What implications do these insights have for the future of the discipline?\n\nWe want to contribute to debates on Africa-centred knowledge(s); touchpoints between memory (incl. forgetting and recalling of events) and history; the “work” history does in the public sphere; co-production between community members and the academy; North-South collaborations; digital humanities for Africa; “postcolonial” African archives; peace & the preservation of the past.\n\nAmongst other things, we propose that in order to capture local practices of historical knowledge transmission, it is necessary to move beyond the printed word to analyse other forms of media, whether audio or visual. It is in this rich multiplicity of intellectual expression that Africa-based African Studies serves as a potential model for how to “reconfigure African Studies” (globally).\n\nWe apply a range of approaches to the subject.",

  "description": "The speech activity of advice-giving and -receiving is part of learning experiences as well as an important aspect of the social organization and transfer of knowledge, of “practical epistemology” (Sidnell 2005b), in everyday life. This research project focuses on facets of learning (and resistance) in the context of advice-giving and advice-receiving in multilingual Cameroon. This study is situated at the interface of variational linguistics and pragmatics and will investigate Cameroonian English, Pidgin and selected indigenous languages contrastively and relationally with regard to norms and organization of this complex linguistic activity, the particular role (expert/user) as well as the uneven distribution of power and social relations (including gender and age) which is associated with the interaction. This will also be compared and related to advice-giving in French (cf. Drescher 2012) and to other postcolonial contexts in the African diaspora, Jamaica. Advice/ counseling will be considered in an exemplary way since it is an act of communication which involves knowledge transfer in many everyday situations (e.g. family life, romance) as well as in institutional contexts (e.g. the health sector, education). Arguably, advice in mediated contexts – e.g. in “Dear Dolly” advice columns in the Drum Magazine in postcolonial Anglophone urban centres in Africa - has played an enormous role in the negotiation of social norms in courtship and sexuality ever since the early 1960s (Mutongi 2003). This project is thus concerned with the interplay between multiple learning spaces and media in the speech activity of advice, blurring artificial dichotomies of learning in formal and informal, institutional and non-institutional, modern and traditional contexts.",

  "description": "“Fluid Ontologies of Contestation” studies how contemporary political contestation is co-constituted by online and offline processes of mobilization. It focuses on two key cases in Burkina Faso: the 2014 revolutionary uprisings against then-President Blaise Compaoré and the ongoing calls for decolonization, notably from France, in the context of the Sahel crisis. The interdisciplinary project combines social science and computer science methodologies to study the role of social media networks in collective movements that challenge established power relations on the national and transnational level. The project’s relevance lies in exploring contemporary fluid topographies of contestation across virtual and physical spaces. As various analysts have shown, contemporary social and political movements intertwine online and offline mobilization techniques to the point where each is co-constituted by the other (Castells 2015; Sebeelo 2021). The boundaries of social and political movements are no longer geographical and its participants and antagonists are spread across the globe. Analyzing them thus demands a radically relational perspective that links different medialities, sites, political struggles, inequalities and frustrations, and ideologies in the making. The project, developed in close collaboration between the ACC Ouagadougou and the Cluster in Bayreuth, aims at theorizing contestation from within the specific context of Burkina Faso while at the same time highlighting the fluid and porous boundaries of that context. Finally, we seek to explore the potential of the Cluster’s concept of “fluid ontologies” beyond the realm of IT.",

  "description": "Au Burkina Faso le terrorisme a engendré une situation sécuritaire et sociale délétère. Selon l’ONU, le nombre de déplacés internes du fait du conflit a atteint 843 329 en avril 2020. De nos jours, près de 1.000.000 d’habitants sont en déshérence sur toute l’étendue du pays et les pertes en vies humaines s’élèvent à plus de 2000.\n\nDans le contexte actuel du terrorisme, les communautés sont perçues comme des acteurs passifs faisant l’objet de sensibilisation, ou parfois même comme les auteurs ou complices du terrorisme. Certaines font alors l’objet de mesures répressives, suscitant incompréhensions, frustrations et indignation. De fait, l’une des limites de la lutte contre les effets du terrorisme tient aux grandes difficultés rencontrées par les acteurs institutionnels à mobiliser les acteurs communautaires et à mettre en place des collaborations actives et efficaces.\n\nLes résultats permettront de comprendre les perceptions et les représentations communautaires du terrorisme par les populations et surtout de révéler leur patrimoine socio-culturel de gestion des crises. Il s’agira de donner la parole aux populations pour cerner leur mode d’appréhension, de signification, d’identification du terrorisme et les comportements qui y sont liés. Les populations concernées vont dire par ellesmêmes ce que c’est que le terrorisme, ses causes, ses manifestations, ses conséquences. L’étude va répertorier les types de violences, les acteurs de la violence, les traumatismes subis par les victimes, notamment les femmes, les enfants et les personnes âgées.\n\nLe travail s’intéressera aux sources endogènes de résilience face au terrorisme ainsi qu’au griot comme dépositaire des mémoires ancestrales, de la tradition, des us et coutumes. Ces griots vivent dans les communautés où sévit le terrorisme et continuent de jouer un rôle important. Une comparaison sera faite à ce niveau avec la même situation au Nigéria. Les résultats de l’étude pourront servir à plusieurs types d’acteurs dont l’État burkinabé, les Organisations de la société civile, les ONG de l’humanitaire pour la sécurisation et la protection des populations sous le terrorisme.",

In our project, we investigate the impact of globalization on health policies in West Africa both at a country (Burkina Faso) and at regional levels. In this investigation, we consider conceptual differences between International Health as represented by the work of the WHO, a United Nations’ intergovernmental organization, and Global Health represented by new multilateral global health organizations having a common Public Private Partnership (PPP) pattern. We assume that the impacts of Global Health activities can be detected and analyzed both at regional and local governance levels and that the impacts may be different from those of the international health because of the PPP pattern of the new actors and activities. Moreover, we are seeking to study the temporality and modality of the interactions between global health and local health which shall allow us to better understand the shifting movement from international health towards the global Health.",

  "description": "Few ideas have travelled around the globe as successfully as that literacy is a basic need, right and standard throughout the world. Today, people everywhere move through lifeworlds heavily shaped by written signs, even as new illiteracies constantly emerge amidst the apparent failure of ‘development through education’. Master narratives about illiteracy situate it as ‘historical’ or ‘traditional’: something tha will become obsolete. In contrast, our project assumes that not having learnt to read and write at school can no longer be seen as ‘old’ or ‘other’. Instead, we see ‘new’ illiteracies as related to and constantly produced by ongoing global processes that mainstream western-oriented literacy through schooling. The project aims to test this assumption by studying the lifeworlds and processes for coping with illiteracy of urban adults in Benin, Bolivia and (much less extensively) Germany. We identify similarities and differences in our case studies but acknowledge that both countries are influenced by the same global processes of mainstreaming literacy. We aim to understand the multiple ways of non-school learning that help actors who have not learnt to read and write interact with the expectations of a world of literacy and chose these countries because they are striking examples of the deficiencies of globalised literacy discourses and practices on two continents."

  "description": "The educational landscape in rural West Africa is currently shaped by a unique historical process. As a result of the large globally influenced schooling campaigns supported by highly influential global actors (UN-Millennium Development Goal II, 2000–2015), which aimed to contribute to the global enrolment of all boys and especially girls, a whole generation of young adults is now growing up who have almost all at least briefly attended school. Many of them were educational pioneers in their families. Thus, a whole generation of youths who were deeply influenced by these campaigns and the related immense hopes and expectations is now becoming adult. However, only a small minority have finished secondary school. Within this unique historical context, our project asks about the roles multiple learning processes – within and outside of school – play in becoming an adult, making a living, and earning a livelihood in one francophone country, Benin. Understanding making a living as a relational and multifaceted process entangled with socio-economic conditions, as well as social embeddedness and hopes of upward mobility, we ask how the general and abstract promises and hopes of the schooling campaigns are related to actual biographical processes. Population growth, scarcity of land, the rising importance of formal exams and specific problems of the formal labour markets seem to be obstacles to finding one’s place in adult life."

  "description": "Africa’s linguistic and cultural diversity constitutes both a challenge and a resource for the creation of learning spaces. Recent research has focused on the translanguaging of multilingual speakers who use their full linguistic repertoires, including features from multiple languages to meet communicative and academic needs in their languages (cf. Garcia 2009, Garcia & Li 2014, Hamman 2018). However, the precise processes and motivations to employ translanguaging strategies (e.g., codeswitching, code meshing, use of localised discourse markers and translation) in the classroom as ‘the very heart of the formal educational process’ (Jo Arthur 2013: 374), as well as outside the classroom, and the consequences for learning effects are yet to be empirically investigated. Our focus country, Kenya, has a highly diverse linguistic repertoire using English, Kiswahili, 43 local languages, and Sheng, an urban mixed variety. We want to find out how these languages coexist in formal educational spaces, especially because English is the stipulated language of instruction in Kenya from grade four to higher education. In this research, we explore the extent of communicative competence by learners in rural schools, including their teachers, in the ex-colonial European language of instruction. Thus, this project aims to provide a more detailed understanding of how teachers and learners relationally use translanguaging strategies in multilingual in and out-of-class interactions in Kenyan schools. This study seeks to bridge the gap between the theoretically under-specified relational function of languages and empirical evidence for the effects of multilingual practices in the classroom and within the school premise. The school environment is intriguing to investigate because it offers a learning ecology that shows: (a) the relationship of speakers with other people and texts, (b) the relationship between the languages used in a postcolonial context, as well as (c) an individual’s relationship with the learning environment. We base our discussions on strategic translanguaging and interliteracy in learning processes as well as social interactions, which are interwoven in the relational work approach and the discursive construction of identity, power, and face work in multilingual spaces. The results are expected to blur the dichotomy between the prescribed language of instruction (English) versus the practised language(s) (ethnic Kenyan language(s) and Kiswahili) in both content and language classrooms and outside the classroom. This research is relevant for the ongoing debate on Kenya’s language-in-education policy regarding new possibilities and approaches in multilingual education (cf. Ogutu & Kanana 2003, Mwaniki 2016, Mukewa-Lisanza 2020) which is highly important for communicative competence and dissemination of knowledge. Empirical evidence is crucial here because policies are ‘socially constructed and dynamically negotiated on a moment-by-moment basis’ (Garcia & Menken 2010: 257). While using multiple languages is an excellent resource for Kenyan speakers, it also challenges institutional settings like education, where language choice is highly regulated. In this diverse and multilingual environment, learners face challenges in expressing ideas, negotiating meaning, presenting arguments, and explaining their imaginations, among others, particularly in rural parts of Kenya, where learners are not effectively prepared in language activities to cope with instruction of English language in lower primary schools."

  "description": "The overarching goal of this project is to decolonize learning ‘about Africa’ in the classroom at schools in Germany. Both, in western societies and especially in classrooms, the construction of ‘Africa’ as an antithesis of ‘Europe’ is still dominant. The ideas and images are predominantly shaped by colonial discourses which are reproduced and still exist in textbooks, teaching materials and the perceptions of teachers and learners. Besides dominant narratives of ‘Africa’ as a continent dominated by conflicts, poverty and deficits as well as primitiveness and natural landscapes, the development of Africa, especially in terms of economic growth has gradually been considered. However, this perception is often based on a model of development which implicitly follows European norms. Study shows that most teachers are not even aware of these various facets of Eurocentrism and, furthermore, they do not have ideas of how to deal with them in classrooms. Based on different didactic approaches (e. g. constructive understanding of space, multi-perspective perceptions and representations, post-colonialism) we are analysing existing teaching materials and will prepare current research findings from the Cluster to contribute to a multi-perspective view, by including voices, narratives and concepts from ‘Africa’ to be used in the classroom. Therefore, the project PLURA 2.0 provides an online-platform, which will offer continuously new teaching materials about ‘Africa’, in order to contribute to a deconstruction and critically reflection of Eurocentric perceptions of ‘Africa’. The forerunner initially started in 2017 as part of the knowledge transfer strategy of the Bayreuth Academy of Advanced African Studies (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, BMBF); the initial database was launched in May 2019, and is currently analysed and updated, in compliance with the outlined project methods."

  "description": "The overarching aim of this project is the establishment of a dynamic archive of Islamic culture in Africa based on innovative digital working formats, developed together with mostly Africa-based cooperation partners. Other than conventional research projects dealing with Islamic learning and education, this project takes a collaborative and multi-sited approach to academic knowledge production. It is based on the idea of creating a space for joint knowledge production between cooperation partners from Germany and Africa. As we take an interdisciplinary and multi-sited approach, the diverse composition of our project team is key. The four-year funding period will serve to test and refine the research approach and digital tools through focusing on those aspects of Islamic culture that revolve around religious learning in the widest sense. For the purpose of this project, we conceive of learning as processes where teachings and practices pertaining to Islam are conveyed; these may be found in formal education, but extend to many other settings and contexts. In addition, given the interconnectedness of learning networks, we include data on religious organizations and networks. If successful, we envision a long-term perspective for the project beyond the first funding period and include other realms of Islamic culture in Africa."

  "description": "Refugee camps have become a key instrument in the global governance of migration: Today, they are one of the main forms in which refugees are administrated, sheltered, and assisted. However, most actors involved in camp management (including states, international aid organizations and refugee communities) agree that putting refugees into camps eventually brings more problems than it solves (health and environmental problems, stress on the local labor market, spread of violence). This raises the question, how have refugee camps become the dominant refugee management tool in Africa?\nRefugee camps are mobile devices for the care and control of mobile people. Despite well-established criticism of such encampments from both scholars and humanitarian practitioners, these camps are still key instruments in managing refugee (im)mobility. Inspired by mobility studies, this project will ask why and how refugee camps emerge and what knowledge, personnel, and things must be mobilized to ‘make’ a camp. The common narrative of refugee camp history portrays them as a device that emerged in the 1940s in Europe and was transferred to Africa in the 1960s. However, we argue that there is a longer and globally entangled history of encampment in Africa. Therefore, we take a closer look into the history of refugee encampment in Africa, focusing primarily on the 1940s and 1950s in Eastern and Northern Africa.\nThis project examines the encampment processes in three interrelated case studies: First, we will examine the transfer of colonial knowledge from Africa to the European post-war refugee administration. We will look into the career paths of former colonial administrators who changed their employment to work for UN refugee aid organizations. Secondly, we will consider the hosting of European refugees in African camps during World War Two, focusing on the work of the UNHCR’s predecessor organizations in Africa. Thirdly, we will analyze the emergence of refugee camps in Uganda in the late 1950s. These camps were established under colonial rule to deal with refugees from Rwanda, Sudan, and Kenya and were only later taken over by international aid organizations."

  "description": "The research group investigates historically and in comparative fashion how Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria have attempted to increase their political and economic sovereignty with a particular focus on the interaction between governments, finance and labor. The group attempts to find out historically how these West African countries became exporters of only one or two commodities with the help of foreign capital and military force. In the second step, we focus on how postcolonial, newly independent governments have attempted to move away from this with the help of domestic resources, the creation of public and private banks, foreign debt and, most recently, stronger relations to China since independence. Increasing economic complexity, diversifying the economy and thus to reduce dependencies on the world market have been perennial pursuits but have often failed. The Covid crisis has put this into stark relief, again. How can we explain recurrent debt crises and the difficulties in moving away from raw commodity export dependency? Which role do global and domestic social relations play and what does that mean for the state in West Africa? To find answers to these questions we investigate the role of colonial legacies and the various attempts by governments to increase national self-determination through public policies to arrive at a nuanced picture of what can be done in the current global political economy."

  "description": "Kenya has become one of the leading venture capital (VC) destinations in Africa. This has been buttressed by ambitious ideological projects such as Silicon Savannah, which has tried to re-brand Nairobi and its greater environs as an innovation hub. Many starts-ups have emerged from this landscape and attracted venture capital, often from funds based in North America and Europe. A closer look at the Kenyan start-up eco-system, however, complicates narratives about ‘Africa success stories’ and self-determined development. Studies and practitioners have repeatedly highlighted that the existing ecosystem is highly stratified by race, ethnicity and gender and that mostly start-ups with ‘White male faces” have received funding and are credited with success. Indeed, the VC scene, heavily influenced by North American standards of ‘doing things’ is socially very homogeneous, usually offering less social mobility to non-White persons. In this project, we account for the fact that capital accumulation in venture capital domains is a process often mediated via raced, gendered and ethnic social relations with strong historical underpinnings. However, we also seek to move beyond a purely pessimist view to uncover the full range of factors that shape social (im)mobility in Silicon Savannah. This will be explored via a combination of assembling a data bank on the socio-economic profiles of founders in the Kenyan entrepreneurial ecosystem and detailed entrepreneurial biographies. The project will also focus on the institutional level to uncover how actors representing the institutional context assess and seek to address the funding challenge and to undo the colonial legacies engrained in the ‘law of start-up money’. The project contributes to the Research Section on mobilities, where currently both the issue of capital mobility and social mobility among entrepreneurs in the formal economy are absent as themes. Links to the RS affiliations and moralities may be developed."

  "description": "In the world’s drylands, the COVID-19 pandemic is adding uncertainty to the lives of people already facing challenges from climate change, political instability, food insecurity, poor services and land conflicts. It is also exposing the relevance of local strategies for living with environmental variability, such as strategic mobility. Most research on COVID-19 in the drylands has focused on the health implications and not on the effects of state-enforced containment measures. Most critically, these works are only slightly informed by the perspectives of members of affected communities. We propose to address these gaps by exploring two dimensions of dryland lives and livelihoods that have been most affected by control measures – mobility and sociality. Adopting a transdisciplinary and participatory framework, we will investigate the socially differentiated impacts of the evolving COVID-19 restrictions, and local responses to them. Under current travel restrictions, data will be provided by collaborative researchers living in 18 dryland countries – farmers, pastoralists and students; women and men of different ages and socioeconomic statuses – who are directly affected by the containment measures and report on their experience thereof. We are applying to the Africa Multiple Cluster of Excellence for funding to support our research on the medium-term dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the drylands. More specifically, we will explore how changes in im/mobility and sociality interconnect with food security, land issues, environmental conservation, religious discourses, (electoral) politics and education. Pandemic waves, mutations and emerging vaccine conflicts make this examination of COVID-driven impacts and responses in some of the most marginalized regions urgent. Exploring the multifaceted and unfolding COVID-19 experience in dryland areas can illuminate questions about dryland livelihoods, while contributing to theoretical debates about mobility and sociality."

  "description": "East Africa’s oil industry is shaping into a sector of significant politico-economic importance. Discoveries of commercially viable hydrocarbon deposits in Uganda’s and Kenya’s Lakes Albert and Turkana Basins respectively, have influenced ambitious infrastructure developments that start from but go beyond the two countries. This places the region in a geopolitical resource spectrum, marked by two multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects. Uganda is fast tracking the development of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) project between Hoima and Tanga; as Kenya develops its multi-model Lamu-Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport (LAPSSET) corridor, with an oil-pipeline component to move the country’s oil from Turkana to Lamu port. Each of these projects forms part of national development visions, that are well-knitted into a complex network and interconnections of international, transnational and local actors. These interconnections highlight the significance of performing mobilities. In this project, we explore how “oil movements” viewed within the perspective of these two projects, shape multiple (im)mobility landscapes, practices, relations; and how these landscapes, practices and relations are rendered (un)governable."

  "description": "In the last two decades, discarded electrical and electronic equipment (commonly known as e-waste) has grown greatly and become a powerful signifier of the detrimental environmental effects oof digital capitalism. This crisis of e-waste has drawn the attention of activist and environmental groups, policymakers, international news media, and academics (BAN 2007; UNEP 2017; The Guardian 2020). Although ignited by broader issues of planned obsolescence and overconsumption of digital technologies, the overwhelming majority of discussions has revolved around the proliferation of e-waste processing hubs in the Global South. The inner-city scrapyard, Agbogbloshie, in Ghana’s capital Accra for instance, has been singled out by NGOs and international media coverage on e-waste. While this coverage and policy directions continue to be dominated by binary stories of e-waste originating in the Global North and polluting the Global South, academic research on the geographies of e-waste (see Lepawsky 2014; 2018, Davis et al. 2019; Akese 2019) has shown that the empirical picture is much more complex. First, e-waste flows are far from unilateral, as depicted in many widespread reports, with the majority of trade happening between countries of the Global South and within regional blocks such as the EU (Lepawsky 2014). Second, the majority of electronic devices arriving in African countries are functioning (Schluep et al. 2012). In Ghana, trade data shows that only 10% of second-hand goods imported by commercial sellers do not function (Ghana E-Waste Country Assessment, 2011, p. 25). Third, the majority of waste and emissions arising from electronic devices happen before consumption rather than after (Lepawsky 2018). These insights provide the main impetus for our project: rather than narrowly focusing on e-waste streams from Germany to Ghana, we study the various multi-directed mobilities and relationalities of electronic device – of design practices, material journeys of the devices, and their repair cultures in both countries."

  "description": "Spatio-temporal variability and mobility characterize socio-ecological systems in large regions of tropical Africa, especially in savanna ecosystems. Hence, in rural areas people have adapted to climatic variability with mobility as a livelihood strategy. While land tenure systems introduced during the colonial times restrict mobility, climate change and economic drivers are likely to increase the need for mobility as an adaptation strategy. The extent to which people adapt to economic, cultural and climate change through movement will have consequences for practices of resource valuation and valorization (the practice of transforming nature into objects with market values), recalibrating questions of sustainability in these socio-ecological systems. Therefore, there is a need to understand the complex interactions of ecological, social, economic and cultural factors. Understanding the processes, their dynamics and interlinkages is only possible in inter- and transdisciplinary approaches involving stakeholders from the region. There is already a good understanding how socio-ecological pressures reshape mobility landscapes in Africa but comparative studies on how new patterns and processes of mobility reshape land tenure systems and on the valorization of resources as well as the underlying normative and ontological fabric (practices of valuation) are still lacking.\nOur aim is to address these knowledge gaps in a three-step approach. The first step is a multivariate statistical scoping of the process interlinkages using existing data and data gathered in the project. Already during this stage we work inter- and transdisciplinarily. The identified parameters will be used in a movement model inspired by Darcy´s law. The model output will be continuously discussed in transdisciplinary meetings and discussion, and based on them adjusted, as there is an increasing acknowledgement that the relations between value, values, and natures are contested. The model will then be used to project movement under storylines representing different climatic, cultural and economic pathways."

  "description": "Much of the ongoing violent conflict in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo is related to both volunteer and forced migration of Kinyarwanda speakers in the past, and linked disputes of autochthony, identity and access to land. In the course of one of the most recent population movements in the region, the massive, but until now non-documented migration of Hutu peasants from North Kivu to Ituri, one can already observe the development of similar conflict lines. By empirically analysing the migration of Hutu to, and their settlement in, Ituri, as well as the rumours and stereotypes travelling with this population movement, this research project will conceptualize the Banyarwanda movement, the migration of Kinyarwanda speakers, as a 'travelling idea' which connects and reconnects various actors along its trajectory and results in a variety of informal conflictual institutions and assemblages which can both trigger and solve conflict. The dissemination of the idea of Uhamaji wa wanyerwanda is not a linear transplantation from A to B. Instead, emphasis should be given to co-production and practices seeking to deliberately frame this migration pattern in strategic ways to serve certain political and economic purposes."

  "description": "The project investigates manifestations of ethics or morality– two concepts we use interchangeably – in everyday conversation by zooming in on health communication in Cameroon and Ivory Coast. It draws on constructivist and phenomenological conceptualizations of ethics by assuming that there are no moral phenomena as such, but that ethics is intimately tied to interaction. According to this view, conversationalists are ‘doing ethics’ by constantly and co-constructively bringing about the moral meaning of a state of affair or an event. Hence, doing ethics relies largely on communicative practices. With our interest in moral communication, we first aim to gain a better understanding of the still under-investigated relation between ordinary ethics and language in general. Second, and more specifically, we intend to examine some of its linguistic manifestations and thus to contribute to a description of pragmatic features in African varieties of French."

  "description": "Our project sheds light on the ways in which Afro-descendant communities resist and (re-)exist in (post)colonial and (post-) enslavement Latin America. We focus on Salvador da Bahia (Brazil) and Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), two major arrival ports of “The Black Atlantic” (Gilroy 1993). These traumatic places of colonisation and the trade in enslaved Africans are marked by racial discrimination and socio-spatial exclusion. At the same time, their colonial city centres are recognised as UNESCO World Heritage since the 1980s, attracting thousands of tourists every year. In this ambivalent context, we focus on peri-urban neighbourhoods which tend to be ‘off the map’ for many tourists, researchers and political actors. In the face of inequality, violence and poverty, their dwellers are often stigmatised across-the-board as if they were morally inferior and incapable of fostering a peaceful social transformation. By contrast, we analyse how self-organised community initiatives may not only (re)valorise Afro-descendant identities, but also change people’s “moral topographies” (Taylor 1989) of what is right and good, altering their visions of a good life. Our transdisciplinary triangulation of ethnographic approaches, documentary methods and participatory action research integrates local communities and artists into joint reflections to stimulate mutual learning processes across the African diaspora."

  "description": "The Junior Research Group “Politics of the Unknown. Conspiracism and Conflict” revolves around the question of how political conflicts shape, and are shaped by, different perceptions of truth and reality. The project consists of several case studies zooming in on contexts of particular uncertainty. Saïkou Sagnane and Kingsley Jima, for instance, focus their PhD research on the Guinean coup d’état in 2021 and the ongoing Nigerian media debate on banditry (the so-called “unknown gunmen”) in the country’s Northwest, respectively. In Guinea, Joschka Philipps leads an interdisciplinary team of researchers and artists concerned with the broader history of Guinea, fraught with real and imagined neo-colonial conspiracies against Guinea’s First Republic under Sékou Touré. He is also co-writing the auto-biography of Nana Barry, a former political broker in Conakry who now lives in France. The overall research agenda is to study, depict, and capture everyday political situations in which people and political actors are confronted with political realities that are too inaccessible to be known and too significant to be ignored. Whether this concerns secrets, suspicions or rumors that circulate about a given event, the difficulty of distinguishing between true or false information on social media, or the ways in which power is imagined and situated in an increasingly uncertain and multipolar geopolitical context, the project highlights how questions of truth become a battleground in situations of conflict."

  "description": "Our interdisciplinary research group studies projects of transformation in Niger. These projects are pursued by state and non-state actors who allude in their practices and visions of change to Islam and/or Christianity. Specifically, we are looking at a Salafi organisation, Turkish NGOs and the Turkish state, and Pentecostal churches. We propose the concept of “religious engineering” to analyse those active and conscious attempts to work on the future shape of society where the actors refer to religious resources such as religious knowledges, practices, identities, or institutions. Understanding such projects of changing or improving the Nigerien society as “alternative” projects of transformation, we want to explore epistemologies, practices, and moralities of transformation that leave the well-trodden paths of international development and at the same time reconfigure religious traditions. Based on these different cases, we study how the actors work towards the change they consider necessary and possible, and in which ways they relate to religious resources as well as to other actors and projects, donors, and target groups. We are particularly interested in the moral making of this “otherwise” and the moralities generated in and through transformative\npractices."

  "description": "This project proposes to investigate histories and politics of sexuality in three African coun- tries (Tunisia, Ethiopia, Sudan), which recently experienced political transformations, in order to shed light on glob(c)al and historical forms of unequal relations. In 2011, Tunisians took to the streets what sparked social movements and protests in other parts of North Africa and the Middle East in what was dubbed as the “Arab Spring”. The #OromoProtest (2014-16) in Ethiopia led to a political transformation in 2017/8, a development of great significance in shaping the course of events in the horn region of Africa. In December 2018/9, Sudanese popular protests led to the ousting of Omar al Bashir who had been in power for three decades. If, akin to Walter Benjamin (1968), moments of danger are those that blast “out of the continuum of the historic process”,1 these political developments were indeed moments of danger that disrupted continuities in authori- tarian grip on power and laid bare the problematics of historicist (pre)dispositions. Just as they\n1 Quoted were moments of danger for the oppressors, they could be viewed as “moments of hope” replete with possibilities for the oppressed to shake the roots of their longstanding subordination. With this in mind, the current project asks if and what possibilities these moments have created for sexual minorities and what we might learn about broader socio-political orders, histories and forms of in- equalities in a rapidly globalizing world in which Africa has a complicated “place”. I use sexual mi- norities to refer to those whose practices, experiences and identities/subjectivities do not conform to heteronormative/heterosexual ways of being and living. As such, sexuality is proposed to inter- rogate multiple forms of socio-political and historico-global relations from an Africanist vantage point. In so doing, the project is an effort to delve into interdependences and (in)commensurabili- ties in order to propose ways of reconfiguring African Studies."

  "description": "This project deals with human rights (HR) focusing on collective human rights and corporate social responsibility (CSR) of businesses in the context of regional economic communities (RECs) in Africa. Regarding multinational corporations, there has been a growing attentiveness on the matter of corporate social responsibility. This is shown by the aspiration of several court decisions in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America in which multinational companies have been legally held accountable for their actions in African host states. Most academic attention has been towards market and trade integration research, whereas areas such as renewable energy, climate change and environmental issues have relatively been neglected. Albeit, these areas raise important questions and research opportunities that are dealt with in this project. Coupled with the fact that human rights of the respective communities (e.g. food and water) might be negatively impacted by the actions of multinational corporations, collective HR and CSR are crucial not only in the scholarship but also in the application in practice. An issue that occurs in African states and the communities is the heterogeneity of different legal systems, which is also referred to as “legal pluralism”. Wherefore, the evolution of collective human rights is being analysed. Furthermore, religious perspectives are taken into account in regard to human rights and corporate social responsibility, whereby the focus is on the Muslim community."

  "description": "Intractable problems of human rights is a 48 months project that is being implemented at the Chair of African Legal studies, the University of Bayreuth in collaboration with the University of Rhodes in South Africa. The project focuses on three intractable problems of human rights, which are child labour, human trafficking, and the protection of LGBTQI+ rights, so defined because of the seeming impossibility to resolve them This project interrogates the question of why despite the establishment of extensive legal frameworks across Africa, some human rights violations persist with little or no change. Tremendous strides in the legal and institutional protection of human rights in Africa have seen the African Union champion an ever-growing framework of treaties and institutions dedicated to human rights protection. These moves have been complemented over the past 30 years with the adoption by many African countries of very progressive constitutions with dedicated bills of rights. However, despite these steps, many African citizens still suffer the yoke of human rights abuses and in some cases, their situations seem worse. For example, child labour continues to rob many African children of their future. In 2016, the International Labour Organisation estimated that one-fifth of all African children were involved in child labour. In countries across Africa, colonial-era laws continue to deny many citizens the right to choose whom they will love (HanO’Mahoney 2018). Right across the continent, from Algeria to Zimbabwe non-heterosexual relationships are subject to heavy penalties (Debele 2020) including in some cases death. The basic premise of this project is that several tough human rights problems have remained unresolved despite long years of legal assault. The project will be undertaken through an examination of three comparative case studies namely child labour, human trafficking and LGBTIQ rights in six selected countries. The programme of work and the project’s key structures and activities are built around these three case studies."

  "description": "Many African States are members of more than one regional community whose objectives and declared aims are economic, legal and/or political integration. Tanzania, for instance, is both member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and of the East African Community (EAC), but not of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), whereas other EAC and SADC members are equally COMESA members. Thus, it is commonplace that multiple, overlapping and potentially competing economic, legal and political affiliations influence the status quo of regional integration. Due to the nature of regional integration, the MuDAIMa project aims at a truly transdisciplinary analysis of the entangled integration situations and its relational implications by combining economics, law and political science."

  "description": "Studying the trajectory of a “knowledge state” in Africa is a challenging task. This is ironical in the sense that the institutionalization of science is the oldest research topic in the sociology science (Ben-David and Sullivan 1975), going as back as the 1920’s. Interestingly, the scholarly interest in this topic led to a significant shift in the understanding of science, which breaks with the scientism (Kleinman 2005) of the old paradigm and defines science as “an institution based on a set of values and standards to which scientists are expected to conform” (Vink 2007:38). Most importantly, studies on this topic have shown that the rise and consolidation of scientific institutions in Western societies can be explained by mainly state sponsorship, thanks to its perceived value for the political leadership. In contrast to this background about science in Western societies, there is a gap in the literature on science in Africa regarding the status of scientific institutions in society; little is known about the relationship between scientific institutions and the other institutions of the social system –particularly the state, whose sponsorship has been shown to be historically instrumental, elsewhere, to the institutionalization of science. The present research project sets out to contribute to fill this gap in the literature on science in Africa, by looking at the configuration processes between the state and science in two African countries, namely Burkina Faso and Senegal."

  "description": "Les centres de détentions/prisons accueillent entre autres, des adolescents/jeunes en conflit ou en danger avec la loi. Ceux-ci ont commis des fautes/crimes et sont souvent enfermés dans des prisons de type colonial. Pendant la colonisation, des centres de réinsertion sociale (Maison de l’Enfance André Dupont de Orodara créée le 13 février 1956 par un missionnaire Blanc et transférée en 1959 à l’État colonial) sont construits pour accueillir des adolescents/jeunes en conflit ou en danger avec la loi. Le post colonial a connu la construction d’autres centres (Baporo, Gampela, Laye, Centre d’Éducation et de Réinsertion des Mineurs en Conflit avec la Loi-CERMICOL-) dont l’objectif est la réinsertion sociale et économique des adolescents/ jeunes. Éduquer et non punir, alors qu’ils sont incarcérés loin de leurs familles d’origine. Notre projet s’intéresse aux différentes formes de circulation des savoirs et des modèles de punition des adolescents/ jeunes dans les sociétés pré et post coloniales. Les circulations de ces formes de savoirs et de modèles de punition sont souvent relayées par des instituions juridiques contemporaines telles que les gendarmeries, les polices, les palais de justice. Cependant, on observe une coexistence de modèles de punition entre les pratiques endogènes et les savoirs contemporains. Il s’agit alors d’interroger les pratiques endogènes en matière de punition des adolescents/jeunes et l’interface entre celles-ci et les systèmes contemporains au Burkina Faso. Nous examinons dans ce projet les stratégies de négociations endogènes (logiques d’acteurs) pour rendre la justice au sein de la communauté ou les formes de médiations dans les règlements des conflits ou des crimes commis dans l’espace territorial au regard des savoirs coloniaux qui y demeurent."

  "description": "Many scientific articles exist on the continent's films. But generally speaking, these scientific productions are fragmented and not systematic. Apart from the colossal work carried out by Victor BACHY in the eighties, which led to the publication of summary monographs on national cinemas (Ivory Coast, Gabon, Upper Volta, Mali...), most of the critical works deal with African cinema in general and deal with specific issues. Efforts of theorization and capitalization are minor, just as monographs on current film productions are almost non-existent. On the Burkinabe cinema, we can nevertheless note some analyses on specific aspects:\n- Justin T. OUORO, \"Contexte d'émergence et orientations thématiques du cinéma burkinabè de 1960 à 2000\" (Context of emergence and thematic orientations of Burkinabè cinema from 1960 to 2000). \"2015, in Annales de l'Université de Ouagadougou, Nouvelle Série A, Lettres, Sciences Humaines et Sociales, volume 020, ISBN 979-10-90524-09-5, Presses Universitaires de Ouagadougou, pp.571-596.\n- Justin T. OUORO, \" Tendances thématiques et esthétiques du cinéma burkinabè de 2000 à nos jours \", June 2015, in Encres, Revue scientifique de l'École Normale Supérieure, Université Abdou Moumouni, Niamey\n-  Niger, N° 001, ISSN 1859-5116, Niamey, pp. 59-70.\n- Justin OUORO, \" Ouagawood et foliewood : acteurs et public d'une dynamique culturelle du cinéma burkinabè \", 2018, Ute FENDLER, Christoph VATTER [eds], Dynamiques culturelles dans les cinémas africains du XXIe siècle. Actors, formats, networks, Universaar Presses Universitaires de la Saare, From Valentine PALM/SANOU's publications we can retain :\n-  \"La métaphore du feu chez Idrissa Ouédraogo\", 2020, in Justin Ouoro and Valentine PALM/SANOU (dir.) Proceedings of the international colloquium in homage to the Burkinabè filmmaker Idrissa Ouédraogo: l'homme et ses œuvres, Burkina Faso, Céprodif editions.\n- \"La modélisation de la violence au cinéma\", 2019, Lettres d'Ivoire, Revue Scientifique de Littératures, Langues et Sciences Humaines, pp. 109-118. The same is true of the monographs of authors that exist, such as the work of Marie Magdeleine CHIROL, 2011, Gaston Kaboré. Conteur et visionnaire du cinéma africain, Presses Universitaires de Lyon, or that of Justin T. OUORO and Valentine PALM/SANOU (dir.) 2020, Actes du colloque international en hommage au cinéaste burkinabè Idrissa Ouédraogo : l'homme et ses œuvres, Burkina Faso, éditions Céprodif. On the gender issue, we can note the doctoral thesis of Lettres Modernes by Sheila PETTY entitled \"La femme dans le cinéma d'Afrique noire\" (Women in Black African cinema) defended since 1987 in Paris 4. This study focuses on the place of women in Black African cinema in front of and behind the camera. However, these data, in addition to being scattered, are nowadays outdated. Furthermore, HARROW's article, K. W. (2016), 'Women in \"African cinema\" and \"Nollywood films\": A shift in cinematic regimes', published in the Journal of African Cinemas, discusses the evolution of the representation of women in African cinema from Fespaco and Nollywood films. In the same vein, Sophie DULUCQ's article, 'Visages de femmes au miroir du cinéma d'Afrique noire (des années 1960 aux années 1990)', published in the review Histoire' femmes et sociétés, takes stock of the themes related to women in African cinematographic works, without taking into account all the dimensions of the female presence in cinema. The present project aims to fill this gap by making available to the public, researchers, and students scientific data on Burkinabe fiction cinema of the extreme contemporary (Barbara H., Pascal M., Pascal R. 2010) and in particular on the specific profile of women's filmmaking practice. The notion of the contemporary extreme is to be understood in a double meaning. It refers to the present, to current productions, those of our lived experience. It also and especially refers to our relationship to contemporaneity, that is to say to the necessary dialectic between our lived experience and the artistic expression of this lived experience. Studying Burkina Faso's extreme contemporary film production, particularly from 2000 to 2020, taking into account the gender dimension and intending to establish a repertoire accompanied by content analysis, means giving ourselves the means to identify one of the most flourishing sectors of artistic activity. It is also to nourish the ambition to grasp the issues, both reflexive and prospective, that inform the state and future of the society that generates these works of the imagination. A better knowledge of the actors and actresses of the seventh art in Burkina Faso, the thematic orientations, the major aesthetics, and the specificity of the female gaze should also facilitate the anchoring of this mode of expression in schools and universities."

  "description": "Human (im)mobility is key for the spread and the containment of the Coronavirus, for internal migration and those targeting Europe and for violent attacks against security forces and the civil population in the borderlands of Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger. Therefore, reducing mobility has been and still is the most common approach to fight the pandemic, migration and insurgence. Mobility as a context-specific ensemble of movement, representations of this movement and concrete mobile practices is political. In the proposed study area the current global redefinition of the politics of (im)mobility translates in new modes of border control, government-imposed mobility restrictions and violent responses to these interventions. In this project we will grasp the entanglements of migration control, pandemic related immobilization and violence and the currently changing (im)mobility regimes emerging from and shaping these entanglements in the border triangle of Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso. Our methodological agenda includes to shift the focus on multiple forms, practices of and responses to (im)mobilities and their entanglements. Theses entangled (im)mobilities are our analytical lens to understand specific locally situated social processes that materialize in specific immobilizations, bordering practices and (violent) modes of situated responses. The project pursues a radically relational and reflexive approach, contributing in particular to the two angles spatialities and modalities. We mobilize multiplicity to avoid standard categories and established binaries. Our empirical agenda will provide us with a rich ethnographic grounding of the making and unmaking of (im)mobility multiplicities by specific technical and political interventions. With this project we will not only increase the international visibility of the ACC in Ouagadougou but also strengthen its regional spillover effects."

  "description": "In Africa, urban river systems are often significantly degraded and recent empirical evidence suggest the accumulation of new pollutants such as macro- and microplastics in such river systems (Grimm et al 2000). However, healthy urban rivers can contribute to and support sustainable urban development through the supply of desired and valued ecosystem services (MEA 2005; Wangai et al. 2017). In this project, we argue that if African urban rivers are to be on an ecologically sustainable path, then, a new approach that recognises the complexity of the interconnectedness and dynamic interactions between social and ecological systems within African urban landscapes, is required. Our just concluded research in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro in South Africa and the Federal Capital Territory in Nigeria focuses on three key components of the concept of urban complexity in relation to urban river ecology and governance challenges i) the imperative for developing multi-dimensional (ecological, social and economic) integrative indicators of urban river health ii) institutional integration failure (i.e. silo operation) as a key governance challenge and iii) the complex interactions and linkages between urban river health and people social-economic well-being on river catchment."

  "description": "Addressing transformation, integration and the decolonisation of the curriculum on several levels, the universities involved whilst locating each epistemological approach. In addition, as traditional modes of learning African musical arts rarely encompass evaluation, assessment as emphasised in current tertiary education models, this study will evaluate the efficacy of each university’s strategy. The pedagogy envisaged should implicate assessment strategies as learning, of learning and for learning. in this study group have developed courses to re-value and promote African ways of making and interacting with music. Approaching decoloniality as contextual, relational, practice based, and lived, each institution has actively engaged in establishing practical indigenous African music making courses that students have access to whilst completing an undergraduate degree (Walsh 2018, 19). The courses are based on an interactive ‘call and response’ methodology which highlights the individual, communal and collective learning of a diverse group of change drivers in what can be a very polarised African society (Kulundu 2018). Each contribution is designed to generate future teachers, culture-bearers and music fans/connoisseurs who will possess a deeper understanding of, and feeling for, indigenous African musics and who, as a result, will be able to engage with African musics through teaching, learning and appreciation at all levels. This type of intervention, referred to as transmission and acquisition in Ethnomusicology, is being practised at universities globally (Kruger 2009; Schippers 2010; Campbell & Higgins 2015), where ethnomusicologists and community musicians teach students about music from around the world. However, in our collective situation, African musical material is being taught to predominantly African students who, for many different reasons, have previously been denied the opportunity to fully engage with music from their own cultures. Students are not learning about music from another country or continent, but rather from their own continent and even their own cultures. Thus, this research is of a critical nature, with the intention being to create knowledge for policy and curriculum change at tertiary level and to highlight the importance of indigenous knowledge as a pathway for identity formation and knowledge production and dissemination. It will encourage a form of transcultural education which will develop avenues for the students to interact with unfamiliar music traditions which will consequently lead to self-examination and an autonomous reconceptualisation of their own relationships, assumptions and preferences (Elliot, 2005, 9–11). This research promotes the musical arts and cultural heritage on the African continent as deeply intertwined and connected, with transgenerational knowledge sharing at its core. It entails inquiry into the teleology of African music pedagogy, looking to establish an understanding of the goals of the institutions"

  "description": "The debates surrounding appropriate teaching pedagogies of African music in African tertiary institutions have raged for decades (Omibiyi 1971; Erlmann 1986; Oehrle 1995; Nzewi 2002; Carver 2002; Herbst 2007; McConnachie 2016) and yet, despite leadership that promotes an essentialised notion of African culture, universities are struggling to incorporate African indigenous and traditional music into the mainstream music curricula. In considering African musical arts, our project proposes to review, analyse, theorise and report on the pedagogical interventions made by music or performance departments at selected universities based in Africa. Viewing the approaches through the methodological lens of embodied learning, (Davidson and Emberly 2012; Leman et al. 2018); experiential learning (Kolb 1984; Kolb 2005, Sternberg and Zhang 2014), one goal of this project is to challenge established norms of teaching and learning music which are still based on pedagogies established in the Global North. This decolonial approach will be achieved through critical reflection of empirical data at partner institutions which engage with traditional African methods of musiciking. These experiential-learning processes, which encourage experimenting with traditional African music knowledge first-hand, may provide insights into transgressive education (Kolb, 1984). The vision for inclusive perspectives of African musical arts pedagogies, referencing innovation and sustainability, builds on this notion of transgressive learning which empowers instructors with tools to reveal, mitigate, and challenge domineering structures in higher education (Drane et al. 2019). The research will report on the development of a collaborative approach to teaching and learning combining arts-based pedagogies and action research around the continent. It will contribute to conceptualising a sonic theory of learning that speaks to the erosion of knowledge and cultures connected to sustainability practices."

  "description": "As scholars and practitioners, our collective research grapples with the role and efficacy of art in activism, social justice and epistemic revolution. In light of the urgent need to respond to growing social inequality, citizens have become impatient and activism has given rise to critical artist-citizens or artivists. While recent studies on activism and the arts tend to frame activism globally and draw from world events of 1989, we complicate this starting point and emphasise contextual and situational forms of resistance and activism . While current sociopolitical, environmental and health crises are in certain ways global, the impact of these crises (spurred by neoliberalism, global capitalism, pervasive deregulation, corruption and on-going violence against women and migrants) is often experienced more acutely in southern spaces that have experienced the injustices of colonialism. Engaging with activism on two levels (protest against specific socio-political conditions and resistance to dominant ways of creating knowledge), we produce research that firmly situates Africa and African knowledge-creation within the global south. While our notion of the south is not tied to physical coordinates, we are driven by “southern epistemologies” (de Sousa Santos 2014) and “strategic southernness” (Simbao 2017) with situational understandings of geography. Employing an inter-contextual approach, our research within this first phase engages with the art and visual culture of Zambia, South Africa, Mozambique, Morocco, Senegal and the DRC in relation to Brazil, China and Spain. Activism in general often relies on simplicity and a sense of urgency in order to achieve high impact in public contexts. Our research explores the complexities and multiplicities of activism through art, and seeks to understand the ways in which resistances and solidarities are entangled. We question how art creation as social justice can be nuanced, reflexive and potentially restorative in the face of pervasive epistemicide (de Sousa Santos 2014) that has, particularly in African contexts, eroded the creation, experience and legitimation of knowledge (Chikowero 2015)."

  "description": "Out of the desire to maximize economic gains and to strategically position themselves in the unfavourable world economic system, most African countries upon attaining independence, moved quickly to embrace regional economic integration as one of the desirable vehicles to this end (Linn and Oksana, 2008). Egged on by the newly formed Organization of African Unity (OAU), discussions that divided Africa into possible six economic blocks followed (Qobo, 2007). Currently the African Union (AU) recognizes eight Regional Economic Corporations in the continent, a clear testimony of the perceived usefulness of Integration (AU, 2019). The African Union on its part treats these RECs as the building blocks for the anticipated African Economic Community.\nHowever, the successes of the RECs are hardly impressive even for those that have lasted for over four decades such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) (Qobo, 2007). Volumes of literature have been dedicated to uncovering and analyzing economic and policy factors that have contributed to the dismal achievements by these RECs even though there is a consensus that they are indeed desirable (Nye 2004, Etzioni, 1962, Trudi, 2011). The markets have not been fully integrated, governance and decision making remains a challenge while many stated objectives are far from being realized.\nThe vexed question of state sovereignty and overlapping membership remain huge obstacles to the full realization of the fruits of integration for many countries. It is therefore important to attempt to understand why RECS as political, economic and social affiliations have not achieved many of their stated goals and how these obstacles and challenges can be overcome. This study proposes to assess the performance of the frameworks of regional integration in Eastern\nand Southern Africa. In doing so, the study will analyze the architecture of interactive markets, governance and decision making, and human rights protection."

  "description": "In Africa, rites of passage remain dominant as social spaces and processes where gender, ethnicity, age, religion, social class and other variables intersect to constitute not just identities but also moral personhood. We explored and analysed identities, moralities and moralities making in contemporary East Africa towards understanding how these are (re)defined, communicated, contested, (re)negotiated, re(invented) and practiced through rites of passage, such as initiation rites and marriages in relation to wellbeing. With dramatic changes resulting from mobilities of things, ideas, and people in social realities in the context of structural changes (such as modernization, urbanization, internationalization), and globalization, emphasis on human agency has emerged as individuals seek to (re)define their individual identities and moralities. Our long-term objective is to better understand differences and similarities in the relational processes of making, shaping and changing of identities and moralities across different communities but also in relation to gender and intersectionality in urban and non-urban contexts across East Africa."

  "description": "Although the history of Asian literary production and engagement in East Africa dates back to 1948, (Gregory 1981; Desai; 2012), it was not until the first decade of independence that emerged what might be described as East African diaspora literature written by authors of South Asian origins writing in English. The emergence of this literature was part and parcel of the literary developments that were taking place in East Africa in the 1960s and which in a way were associated both with the anxiety of independence. This research seeks to trace this emergence and read East African Indian writings as texts that are not only framed by the ambivalent and diasporic histories of Indians in imperial and postcolonial East Africa but also as writings that consciously construct ambivalent diasporic subjectivities as the basis of new forms of East African Indian identities. Such ambivalence reveals itself in the way the authors disavow dominant, nationalistic, even binaristic accounts of colonial relationships and create, instead, narratives that skirt the borderlines of both colonial and nationalist discourses. This constitutes a strategy of contesting both colonial history and the hi/stories of the postcolonial nation-state in East Africa.\nThe consequence of this strategy though, is that while histories of the Indian people in East Africa are uncovered as “scraps” of imperial history their narration tends, on the other hand, to silence those aspects of Asian experiences that align them to African anti-colonial resistance. This research will seek to answer how this irony is resolved by recasting Indian histories in East Africa in diasporic terms even as they indicate their uncertain affiliations to, and identifications with, nationalist narratives of resistance which are themselves already in competition. In this respect fictional works will be read against life history narratives, biographies, autobiographies and art works and thus meet one of the main objectives of the RS which seeks to understand how artists relate to other artists and artworks, for instance through appropriation or rejection of ideas, repertoires of imagery, sounds or other texts and narratives."

  "description": "This project aims at conducting a formative research and disseminating its findings over eighteen (18) months. Findings from the formative research will be used to design a three years research to understand re-configured human identities that result from human (im)mobility in East Africa. The formative research will focus on human agency in mobility, to study using mixed methods, three human and materials mobility spots along the Kenya-Uganda highway. The study assumes that human mobility in East Africa is increasingly agentive and no longer collective, passive and forced. The study further assumes that newer forms of mobility in East Africa are changing people‟s identities. The region is witnessing multiples of agentive mobility and immobility. Human agency will be studied in this stated respect, centring on its influence on mobility choices, processes and outcomes. The central research question is how newer identities form as a result of human mobility and immobility. A mixed methods design and methodology will apply to research and report mobility and immobility. From six multi-disciplines, Moi University researchers joined by one ACC and one AMCE collaborator (as a result of ongoing match-making), will develop formative research protocols on mobility, immobility and identity in three sites: urban Eldoret, Bungoma County both along the Kenya-Uganda highway and in Malaba; a border town of Kenya-Uganda, along the same highway. Researchers will collect formative data in 2020-2021, aimed at four distinct outputs: first, data bases for the Knowledge Lab; second, research findings for dissemination through scheduled workshops and conferences in 2021; third, two co-publications, and; fourth, results, lessons and recommendations for use in 2021-2022 to design a three years Mobilities Project: “Human Agentive Mobility for Livelihoods and emerging Identities in East Africa”, that will test human agency in mobilities that frame identities, using livelihoods, education, health and climate as mobility variables"

  "description": "Livelihoods in Africa are informed by decisions made based on various intelligences available to the local communities (Semali & Kincheloe, 1999). Through the observation and study of nature over time, various knowledge systems have evolved to mitigate different challenges and circumstances touching on human life including provision of medication and healing, food preservation, use of music and rituals, African religion, weather forecast and prediction among others. Without doubt, indigenous intelligence continues to be a key aspect in daily life decision making despite advancements in science, technology and communication (Battiste & Henderson, 2000; Semali & Kincheloe, 1999; Whitt, 2009). Studies have revealed that indigenous knowledge has the capacity to generate transferable local skills and set energies in motion to reduce the prevailing inequalities on the African continent (Ewane and Ajagbe 2018). Clearly, this reinforces the relevance of indigenous knowledge in development practices. It is because of this awareness that Mutekwe (2015) calls upon the need to integrate the indigenous knowledge systems with the various educational curricular found in Africa. In realizing this goal, the local languages should not be left out in the process because they are important carriers of indigenous knowledge, which could enable an individual to understand and access meanings carried in oral and religious art forms (proverbs, folktales, riddles and taboos) (Nyota and Mapara 2007).\nThe main driving idea behind this research project is to establish the indigenous knowledge skills currently in use among selected Kenyan communities. This is with the aim of determining the specific practitioners; analyze the effects of the indigenous skills used on the livelihoods of the people; and to explore the language(s) that embeds (serves as the medium of access, interpreting and transmitting) the respective knowledges. This is with the specific interest of identifying, documenting and eventually preserving the carrier languages of the selected indigenous knowledge systems in Africa. The study will focus on the traditional skills and knowledge touching on Africans daily life with focus on food preservation, language of prediction, and aspects of healing in African religion, music performances and rituals. The following key research questions will guide the study.\n1.How are specific practitioners of indigenous knowledge identified in the selected communities?\n2.To what extent does indigenous knowledge affect livelihoods in the selected communities in Kenya?\n3.In which format is indigenous knowledge processed and transmitted from one generation to the other?\n4.How are power relations between genders reinforced through the prism of indigenous knowledge?\n5.Why has indigenous knowledge persisted despite the advancement of modern day technology?"

  "description": "Though in Africa, Islamic knowledge production and transmission is traditionally associated with male ulama in textual format (Ndzovu 2019), poetry, music and film-video have demonstrated that it could also be transmitted in an uncomplicated form, where female actors participate as well. This simplicity is evident through the production of ‘Islamic-poetry’, ‘Islamic-music’, and ‘Islamic-film video’, where the three public performance practices have established to be practical sources for relaying religious knowledge. Though, the category of Islamic public performance is complex, incorporating aesthetic and ritual practices (Frishkopf 2008), it also reveals diverse attitudes to poetry, music and film video in diverse Muslim societies. Among African Muslims, poetry, music and film-video are important (Kirkegaard 2012), but also disputed part of Islamic discourse (Ibrahim 2017; Adamu 2010). The three purveyors of popular culture not only support religious meanings (McLaughlin 1997), but also give variation in the transmission of religious knowledge, a process that has demystified the traditional textual and religious space of the mosque by embracing social halls, homes and entertainment places. More so, performative arts also remind African Muslims of their identity thereby supporting the socializing processes intended in creating the feeling of cultural belonging (Larkin 2004). Therefore, this research project seeks to examine the role of gender, local languages and performative aesthetics in the production and transmission of religious knowledge and how subsequently the resultant popular culture creates cultural identity and sense of belonging among Muslims in Kenya, Zanzibar, Nigeria and Morocco. The incorporation of multiple disciplines to problematize and interrogate the theme of Islamic popular culture has the potential to generate in a reflexive and relational ways new knowledge on the understanding and usage of the three public performances identified."

  "description": "The project will explore the production and transmission of Islamic knowledge as well as the religious artifacts and institutions involved in these processes in Africa, with a focus on the case study of Kenya. Coming from the disciplinary and methodological angles of Islamic Studies and social anthropology methods, we propose to analyze the ways in which Islamic knowledge gains significance for Kenyan Muslims through various means of transmission, including established educational institutions (madrassas and Islamic-integrated schools), poetry, works of art, and various media technologies. Our aim is to shed new light on the dynamics and workings of Islam in Africa, by studying the changing means of knowledge production, transmission and shifting epistemologies as represented in the appropriation of the various available spaces as means of religious learning in selected locations in Kenya. The study proposes to investigate two aspects related to the production and transmission of Islamic knowledge and learning. Firstly, we will examine the competing madrassa (religious schools) and Islamic-integrated schools (semi-secular or semi-religious) in the production and transmission of Islamic knowledge, focusing on the standardization and consistency in curriculum delivery in the two systems of education. The second strand elongates our study of mediated and mediatized Islamic knowledge to certain forms of performative aesthetic and media technologies, along with their appropriation among Kenyan Muslims as evident in the production of religious CDs/DVDs, radio religious programmes and spiritual poems. Consequently, a field study among key informants and institutions to analyze the influence of established educational institutions, performing art and technologies of knowledge transmission on the negotiation of religious meaning. Therefore, the two strands have the potential to generate a new understanding of the nexus of Islamic learning and religious authority in African Muslim communities, and promise to shed new light on the adaptation and creativity in the transmission of Islamic knowledge among Kenyan Muslims."

  "description": "Pots, fire and gourds are among the instruments of great antiquity. They are used as vehicles of cultural wisdom immortalized in the communities’ cultural practices and heritage. As cultural objects, they store invaluable knowledge about a community’s culture. This knowledge is manifested directly in the objects themselves, or indirectly through linguistic features. The knowledge is enriched within cultural contexts of rituals and ceremonies which define the objects’ roles. Such roles may be direct or symbolic or may relate to both the physical and spiritual worlds. Physically, Pots, fire and gourds are instruments of daily use, while Spiritually, they can be amulets, symbols of creation or tools of divination.\n\nThis project studies how instantiations of pots, fire and gourds in rituals and ceremonies represent social cultural practices as a system of knowledge among the Bukusu, Iteso, and Sabaot of Western Kenya, and the Yoruba of West Africa. Using documentation, observation and interviews, the project targets collections of community folklore on pots, fire and gourds, and an inventory of related names as manifested in birth and death ceremonies, marriage, and transitional rites, and associated rituals. Each of the objects will be analyzed for cultural information using Fleming’s (1974) model of artifact study. The names will be subjected to a linguistic stylistic analysis (Crystal and Dereck 1969) in order to derive cultural meaning associations. The project is motivated by the realization that the survival of a culture is dependent on its artifacts and language. Consequently, documenting folklore and names associated with pots, fire and gourds is a way of cultural preservation. More so, a study of the Bukusu (Bantu), Sabaot and Iteso (Nilotic), three neighbouring communities of Western Kenya, may reveal traces of inter community convergence and interaction. The inclusion of Yoruba provides an opportunity to understand cultural multiplicity and relatedness."

  "description": "The results of the project offer an innovative understanding the controlling of movement\nto contain human mobility that is undesired and designated as a security threat in general\nand international migration towards Europe in particular. We showed the practices of remaking the local border a global one. A multiperspectival study of borders revealed that\nthe border is not only made by the state and their agents, but also by surrounding actors,\nsuch as citizens winning and loosing from shifting border and mobility regimes. The\nproject was able to show how mobility as a context-specific ensemble of movement,\nrepresentations of this movement and concrete mobile practices is above all political. We\ndownscaled the concept of mobility regime to understand (im)mobility regimes as\nconstituted by a specific set of infrastructures and infrastructuring practices through\nwhich movement is contained or, more generally, through which (im)mobilities are\ngoverned, and the ways the targeted subjects respond. Thinking of the relations of\nmobility and stasis as both an outcome of, and the shaping of, a regime allows us to reveal\nthe entangled power relations at work in the respective infrastructures.",

  "description": "The study of the African material culture in museums and other cultural heritage institutions has largely\nconcentrated on documentation, preservation, exhibition and display (Pye, 2001; Ambrose & Paine 1992).\nKnowledge on material culture continue to be provided based on the techniques and materials used in their\nproduction, better ways to keep them from damage, as well as their exchange and what happens to them at\nthe “end” of their “usefulness” (Somjee, 1993; Appadurai, 1988; Kopytoff, 1982). Paine (2013) suggests a new\napproach to study of material culture by looking at significance of objects in creation and maintenance of\nsocial identities build on ethnicities and gender. Studies have shown that each society has a number of\nmaterial culture objects that stores information on ideas, values and conventions that are mutually shared\nand passed down from one generation to another. Through objects, people give meanings and values to\nthings so as to strengthen relationships and distinguish themselves from “others” (Bell & Geismar 2009). This\nis attested by the recent call of repatriation of significant objects taken from communities (Henare, 2005;\nPye, 2001; Bennett, 1995). Globally, culture changes and as it does it affects the technology, art, design and\ntechnique of making objects (Blier, 1998; McNaughton, 1988). Change in material culture objects is\ninfluenced by encounters with different people with new ideas, innovations and goods. On the other hand,\nthousands of traditional objects made from precious materials and high quality craftsmanship continue to\nbe preserved in time and space and also moved across societies. Such objects are iconic and are associated\nwith society’s values and beliefs. This study seeks to analyse (im) mobility of African material culture objects\nand knowledge embedded in them. The focus of the study will be Kenya’s North Rift Region, an area that\nborders Uganda, Sudan and Ethiopia."

  "description": "Over the last few years Africa has been experiencing a (auto) biographical wave. In many ways this has to do\nwith the celebration of independence and liberation. Our project wants to scrutinize this process in thus far\nnew and innovating fashion, which elicits a number of aspects that need highlighting: the gender question,\nthe uses of literacies, the visual culture of independence and the several entanglements that have been so\nfar mostly silenced (between the local and the global, highbrow and popular culture, cosmopolitanism and\nthe politics of ethnicity and race, the South-South connections). The project encompasses three Research\nSections and proposes the creation of a new field: South-South Knowledge Production, by bringing six\nscholars, four from Africa (and two ACCs), one from Brazil and another one from Germany. It consists of\nfieldwork in Mozambique, South Africa and Dar es Salaam, as well as two fieldtrips to ACCs, Moi and Rhodes.\nIts results and outcome will be made available on a digital platform as well as in a monograph, a collective\nbook and a number of academic papers. The project will finalize with the organization of an international\nworkshop to be held at the Universidade Eduardo Mondlane in August 2022. There about twenty scholars,\nten of whom from Mozambique, will engage in discussing the topic – as well as the primary results - of our\nproject: Biographies and Liberation. Of course funds for publications and the organization of the workshop\nwill be applied for separately."
